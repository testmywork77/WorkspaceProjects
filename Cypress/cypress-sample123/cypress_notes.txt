Cypress Dashboard: Build up a suite of CI tests, record their results and gain powerful insights.

What sets Cypress apart?
Time travel: Cypress takes snapshots as your tests run. Simply hover over commands in the Command Log to see exactly what happened at each step.
Debuggability: Stop guessing why your tests are failing. Debug directly from familiar tools like Chrome DevTools. 
Real time reloads: Cypress automatically reloads whenever you make changes to your tests. 
Automatic waiting: Never add waits or sleeps to your tests. Cypress automatically waits for commands and assertions before moving on. No more async hell.

Test Runner Tool:
1. Test Status Menu: See how many tests passed or failed, and how long they took to run.

2. Viewport Sizing: Test responsive layouts by changing your app's viewport size.

3. Browser Menu: Select your desired browser in which to run tests.
4. Orgaize Results: get quick access to results of your latest CI test run s recorded to the Dashboard.
