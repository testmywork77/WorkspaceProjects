Requirements Files:#
“Requirements files” are files containing a list of items to be installed using pip install

pip commands:
# Install a specific version of a package by giving the package name followed by ==/ and the version number:
$ python -m pip install requests==2.6.0

# Install the latest version of a package by specifying a package’s name:
$ python -m pip install requests

# Upgrade the package to the latest version:
$ python -m pip install --upgrade request

# Display information about a particular package:
$ pip show requests

# Display all of the packages installed in the virtual environment
$ pip list

# Freeze will produce a similar list of the installed packages in a requirements.txt file:
$ pip freeze > requirements.txt

$ cat requirements.txt

The requirements.txt can then be committed to version control and shipped as part of an application. Users can then install all the necessary packages with install -r:
$ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

# Uninstall/remove the packages from the virtual environment i.e. requests
$ pip uninstall requests

Note: pip uninstall followed by one or more package names will remove the packages from the virtual environment.
