Note: Node Package eXecute
What is NPX? NPX stands for Node Package eXecute and like NPM, it is installed when we get NodeJS. It is basically a NPM package runner, which allows us to run JavaScript packages without installing it. That means that if you only need to use something just once NPX is perfect, and package pollution is not a concern.
